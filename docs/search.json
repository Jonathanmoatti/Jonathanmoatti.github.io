    "text": "Building Open Source Agents using HuggingFace’s SmolAgents\nTo monitor GPU utilization in real-time, especially when running resource-intensive machine learning tasks, you can leverage the nvidia-smi command. On Ubuntu, simply execute the following command in your terminal (provided that you have an Nvidia GPU):\nwatch -n 1 nvidia-smi\nThis command offers a live, updating snapshot of your GPU’s performance, enabling you to monitor key metrics such as memory utilization and temperature. The watch -n 1 component ensures that this information is refreshed every second. This is particularly useful for debugging, optimizing your machine learning workflows, and identifying specific commands or models that lead to critical “Out Of Memory” errors.\n\nImports & Setup\nIn this initial code block, we start by importing the necessary libraries to construct our local AI agent. Let’s break down the important imports:\n\ntyping: A module to provide type hints for our function signatures, which is a critical part of creating useful tools that our agents that use.\nsmolagents: From the smolagents library, we import:\n\nTool: A base class for defining custom tools that our agent can use.\nCodeAgent: The core class for creating agents capable of generating and executing code.\nTransformersModel: A class to load and manage transformer models.\ntool: A decorator to easily register functions as tools for the agent.\nDuckDuckGoSearchTool: A pre-built tool that allows the agent to perform web searches using DuckDuckGo.\n\nyaml: This library is imported to handle YAML configuration files, allowing us to define agent settings in a structured format.\nyfinance: We import yfinance to fetch stock market data.\n\nThese imports set the stage for building a powerful AI agent that can interact with its environment through code execution and web searches.\nYou can see which dependencies are used for running this notebook by either simply hovering over requirements.txt or by opening it in another window.\n\nfrom datetime import datetime\nfrom typing import Any\n\nimport pytz\nfrom smolagents import CodeAgent, TransformersModel, tool, DuckDuckGoSearchTool\nfrom smolagents.tools import Tool\nimport yaml\nimport yfinance as yf\n\n\n\nDefine your prompt template\nLoad up the adequate yaml prompt template. This one is compatible with the smolagents library and the model we will use. It was taken directly from HuggingFace’s Agents Course.\n\n# Setting up the predefined prompts\nwith open(\"prompts.yaml\", 'r') as stream:\n    prompt_templates = yaml.safe_load(stream)\n\n\n\nUnderstanding AI Tool Creation with SmolAgents\nWhen building AI agents, defining tools properly is crucial for ensuring smooth integration with frameworks like SmolAgents.\nThe first tool we will build today uses the yfinance library to check the status (price) of a given ticker on the North American stock market.\n\nCreating your first tool\nThe function check_NA_market_status is decorated with @tool, marking it as a callable tool within the agent framework. This tool checks whether the stock market is open and returns the latest stock price if open, or the last closing price if closed.\n\nAppropriate type-hinting is Essential\n\nThe function takes a single string argument (ticker: str) and returns a string (-&gt; str).\n\nThis typing ensures that the agent understands the expected input and output format.\n\nWithout this, the function may not work correctly in an AI pipeline.\n\nThe Importance of a Docstring\n\nThe function is documented with a clear, structured docstring explaining:\n\nWhat it does (checks if the market is open and returns the appropriate stock price).\n\nWhat arguments it takes (ticker – the stock ticker symbol).\n\nWhat it returns (a formatted string with market status and price).\n\n\nAI agents rely on this information to understand the function’s role. When/if you build your own tool, it is critical to keep the same docstring template for your code to be compatible with the smolagents library.\n\n\n\nKey Takeaways for developping tools\n\nFollow the function template: Use clear type hints and structured docstrings.\n\nEnsure proper decoration: The @tool decorator registers the function within the SmolAgents framework.\n\nKeep return types simple: AI models parse these results, so returning formatted strings helps with interpretability.\n\nThis structured approach makes it easier for Agents to call tools correctly, understand their functions, and use them effectively in reasoning and decision-making.\n\n@tool\ndef check_NA_market_status(ticker: str) -&gt; str:\n    \"\"\"\n    A tool that checks if the stock market is open for the given ticker and returns the \n    current price if open,or the previous close price if the market is closed.\n    Args:\n        ticker: The stock ticker symbol (e.g., 'AAPL', 'GOOG').\n    Returns:\n        A message indicating whether the market is open or closed, \n        and the price of the stock at the respective time.\n    \"\"\"\n\n    # Get the current time in Eastern Time Zone\n    eastern = pytz.timezone('US/Eastern')\n    now = datetime.now(eastern)\n    parsed_now = now.strftime(\"%A %B %d at %H:%M EST\")\n    current_time = now.time()\n    current_day = now.weekday()  # Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6\n\n    market_open_time = datetime.strptime(\"09:30:00\", \"%H:%M:%S\").time()\n    market_close_time = datetime.strptime(\"16:00:00\", \"%H:%M:%S\").time()\n\n    if current_day &lt; 5 and market_open_time &lt;= current_time &lt;= market_close_time:\n        stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)\n        # Request intraday data: 1-day period with 1-minute interval\n        current_price = stock.history(period=\"1d\", interval=\"1m\")['Close'].iloc[-1]\n        return f\"\"\"As of {parsed_now}, the market is open.\\n    \n        The current price of {ticker} is: ${current_price:.2f}\"\"\"\n    else:\n        stock = yf.Ticker(ticker)\n        previous_close = stock.history(period=\"1d\")['Close'].iloc[-1]\n        return f\"\"\"As of {parsed_now}, the market is closed.\\n\n        The previous close price of {ticker} was ${previous_close:.2f}\"\"\"\n\n\n\n\n\nBypassing LLM’s mathematical computation limitations\nThe fibonacci_tool function is a custom tool designed to compute the nth Fibonacci number. It is decorated with @tool, which allows it to be seamlessly integrated into an AI agent using the SmolAgents framework.\nLLMs, while powerful, often struggle with mathematical computations, especially recursive sequences like Fibonacci numbers. Instead of relying on the LLM’s built-in reasoning which fails, for example, to return Fibonacci numbers past a certain number of steps even with the most powerful models like GPT-4o and o1 - try it for yourself; this tool:\n\nProvides a deterministic and accurate calculation of Fibonacci numbers.\nIs significantly more efficient than recursive implementations, using an iterative approach to avoid excessive function calls.\nEnsures the AI agent always returns correct numerical results rather than relying on approximate or hallucinated values. \n\n\n# second tool\n@tool\ndef fibonacci_tool(n: int) -&gt; int:\n    \"\"\"\n    A simple tool that returns the nth Fibonacci number.\n\n    Args:\n        n: The index of the Fibonacci sequence to retrieve (int)\n\n    Returns:\n        int: The nth Fibonacci number.\n    \"\"\"\n    if n &lt;= 0:\n        return 0\n    elif n == 1:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        a, b = 0, 1\n        for _ in range(2, n + 1):\n            a, b = b, a + b\n        return b\n\n\n\nBypassing the LLM’s training date cutoff\nFinally, we leverage smolagent’s DuckDuckGoSearchTool to create a tool able to fetch up-to-date information from the web.\nThis tool empowers our agent with the ability to quickly retrieve relevant information on demand. Since models training have cutoff dates, this tool will allow us to bypass this cutoff limitation by researching the web for up to date answers to any query we may have.\n\n# third tool\n@tool\ndef duckduckgo_search(query: str) -&gt; str:\n    \"\"\"\n    A tool that performs a real-time DuckDuckGo search for the given query \n    and returns the top results.\n    \n    Args:\n        query: The search query string (e.g., \"Latest AI research 2025\").\n        \n    Returns:\n        A string containing the search results. If the search tool returns \n        a formatted string, it is returned directly; otherwise, if it \n        returns a list of dictionaries with 'title' and 'url' keys,\n        the results are formatted for readability.\n    \"\"\"\n    search_tool = DuckDuckGoSearchTool()\n    results = search_tool(query)\n    \n    if isinstance(results, str):\n        return results\n    \n    formatted_results = \"\\n\".join(\n        [f\"{item.get('title', 'No Title')} -&gt; {item.get('url', 'No URL')}\" \n         for item in results]\n    )\n    return formatted_results\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the Final Answer Tool in AI Agents\nThe FinalAnswerTool is a specialized tool used in AI agent frameworks to consolidate the reasoning process and provide a definitive response. Unlike other tools that fetch data or perform computations, this tool acts as a final step where the AI commits to a structured output.\n\nWhy This Tool Is Important for AI Agents\nAI agents often go through multi-step reasoning before arriving at an answer. The FinalAnswerTool helps in:\n\nEnsuring a structured final response\n\nInstead of returning intermediate steps, the agent commits to a well-defined answer.\n\nImproving interpretability\n\nBy using a dedicated final output tool, responses become more consistent and easier to process.\n\nIntegrating seamlessly into pipelines\n\nMany agent frameworks expect a clear final output format—this tool standardizes the output handling.\n\n\nWhen designing AI agents, tools like this help bridge the gap between reasoning and action, making interactions smoother and more reliable.\nNote: The FinalAnswerTool part of the CodeAgent is currently bugged, as MultiStepAgent from the smolagents library silently overwrites parameter-provided FinalAnswerTool, but I assume the HF team will fix it soon. The version presented below is the static version. If you try to overwrite it, it won’t change anything (for now)\n\n# final answer class tool used after reasoning\nclass FinalAnswerTool(Tool):\n    name = \"final_answer\"\n    description = \"Provides a final answer to the given problem.\"\n    inputs = {'answer': {'type': 'any', 'description': 'The final answer to the problem'}}\n    output_type = \"any\"\n\n    def forward(self, answer: Any) -&gt; Any:\n        return answer\n\n    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):\n        self.is_initialized = False\n\n# instanciate tool\nfinal_answer = FinalAnswerTool()\n\n\n\n\nPicking our LLM and initializing it.\nTo instanciate our agent, we must first create a model instance by setting up a specific TransformersModel and its tokenizer (with CUDA enabled and controlled token limits).\nHere is a link to the model card of the HuggingFace LLM we will be using today 🤗\n\n# pick a model and instanciate it; smaller models risk giving erroneous answers\n# but you can use those if you don't have enough memory\n\n# model_name = \"HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM-135M-Instruct\"\n# model_name= \"HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-360M-Instruct\"\nmodel_name=\"HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM2-1.7B-Instruct\"\n\nmodel = TransformersModel(model_id=model_name, device_map=\"auto\", max_new_tokens=200)\n\n\n\nCreating an AI Agent with Custom Tools\nNow that we’ve built our individual tools, the next step is assembling them into an AI agent. This is done using the CodeAgent class, which takes a language model (model), a set of tools, and other parameters to define its behavior.\nKey Components of the AI Agent:\n\nModel (model) – The LLM that powers the agent’s reasoning and decision-making.\nTools (tools) – A list of functions the agent can use to extend its capabilities.\nMax Steps (max_steps=6) – Limits how many steps the agent can take before finalizing an answer.\nVerbosity (verbosity_level=1) – Controls the level of detail in logs/debugging output.\nPrompt Templates (prompt_templates) – Provides structured instructions for the agent’s behavior.\n\n\n# finaly, create the agent and pass the model, tools, \n# number of steps it should reflect for, prompt template...ect\n\nagent = CodeAgent(\n    model=model,\n    tools=[final_answer,fibonacci_tool, check_NA_market_status, duckduckgo_search], \n    max_steps=6,\n    verbosity_level=1,\n    grammar=None,\n    planning_interval=None,\n    name=None,\n    description=None,\n    prompt_templates=prompt_templates\n)\n\nFinally, we query our agent by passing in our queries to the .run() method.\n\nprint(\"CodeAgent:\", agent.run(\"Could you give me the 118th number in the Fibonacci sequence?\"))\n\n╭──────────────────────────────────────────────────── New run ────────────────────────────────────────────────────╮\n│                                                                                                                 │\n│ Could you give me the 118th number in the Fibonacci sequence?
