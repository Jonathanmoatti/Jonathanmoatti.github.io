ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! Iâ€™m Jonathan. Passionate about artificial intelligence and data science, I love exploring the intersection between academic research and real-world applications. My journey has led me to work in AI R&D in North America's largest financial cooperative (Desjardins), tackling exciting topics like recommendation systems, reinforcement learning, graph neural networks, and self-supervised learning. But beyond algorithms, what truly drives me is sharing knowledge.  

Thatâ€™s why I started *Gradient Dissent*â€”a blog where I walk through entry-level ideas, break down complex AI concepts, share my thoughts on the field, and maybe, just maybe, challenge conventional wisdom along the way.  Why the name? Well, machine learning aficionados are quite familiar with a certain algorithm that methodically fine-tunes models step by step... But me? I like to question, challenge, and sometimes outright disagree with the status quoâ€”hence *Gradient Dissent*. A little stubbornness never hurt anyone, right? ðŸ˜„  

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to teach programming at the HEC Montreal and develop advanced AI training programs. My goal? To make complex concepts accessible and help students, researchers, and professionals navigate this ever-evolving field. I thrive on bridging the gap between theory and practice, supporting learners of all levels in mastering machine learning.  

So, whether youâ€™re here out of curiosity, passion, or professional interest, welcome to *Gradient Dissent*! Expect deep dives, fresh insights, and the occasional rebellious take on AI. ðŸš€
