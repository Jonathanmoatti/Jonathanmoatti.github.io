    "### Introduction: Why AI Agents Matter\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Before diving into the coding process, it's essential to understand the purpose of the program we aim to build. We need to identify the problem at hand and the business value we can derive from solving it...\n",
    "\n",
    "Lol, who am I kidding, we're not at work here, so let's focus on picking problems that are ***fun*** to solve and let the marketing people worry about value creation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jokes aside, today our goal is to learn how to overcome the traditional limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by building Agents that are able to use *custom tools*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While LLMs like GPT-4 are incredibly powerful and capable of performing various tasks such as answering questions, summarizing text, and reasoning about complex topics, they have **significant limitations** when used in isolation. What are those limitations, one may ask?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Lack of Real-Time Data**  \n",
    "   - LLMs are trained on static datasets and *cannot fetch live information* (e.g., stock prices, weather updates, or breaking news).  \n",
    "   - This leads to outdated or incomplete responses.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "2. **Inability to Perform Actions**  \n",
    "   - An LLM can tell you how to book a flight but *can’t actually book it*—it lacks the ability to interact with external systems.  \n",
    "   - Agents, on the other hand, can call APIs, interact with databases, and automate tasks.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "3. **Limited Memory & Context**  \n",
    "   - While LLMs have a context window, they *forget past interactions beyond a limit* and struggle with long-term tasks.  \n",
    "   - Agents can store and retrieve relevant information, improving coherence over long workflows.  \n",
    "<br>\n",
    "4. **Mathematical & Computational Weaknesses**  \n",
    "   - LLMs can make **math mistakes** or fail in complex computations.  \n",
    "   - Agents can call external computation tools (e.g., a Python script or a calculator API) for precise results.  \n"

    "    - `tool`: A decorator to easily register functions as tools for the agent.\n",
    "    - `DuckDuckGoSearchTool`: A pre-built tool that allows the agent to perform web searches using DuckDuckGo.\n",
    "- `transformers`: We import `AutoTokenizer` from the `transformers` library, which will be used to process text data for our models.\n",
    "- `yaml`: This library is imported to handle YAML configuration files, allowing us to define agent settings in a structured format.\n",
    "- `yfinance`: We import `yfinance` to fetch stock market data.\n",

    "### **Understanding AI Tool Creation with SmolAgents**\n",
    "\n",
    "When building AI agents, **defining tools properly is crucial** for ensuring smooth integration with frameworks like [SmolAgents](https://huggingface.co/docs/smolagents/en/index).  \n",
    "The first tool we will build today uses the `yfinance` library to check the status (price) of a given ticker on the North American stock market. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Creating your first tool**\n",
    "The function **`check_NA_market_status`** is decorated with `@tool`, marking it as a callable tool within the agent framework. This tool checks whether the stock market is open and returns the latest stock price if open, or the last closing price if closed.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Appropriate type-hinting is Essential**  \n",
    "   - The function takes a **single string argument (`ticker: str`)** and returns a **string (`-> str`)**.  \n",
    "   - This typing ensures that the agent understands the expected input and output format.  \n",
    "   - Without this, the function may not work correctly in an AI pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The Importance of a Docstring**  \n",
    "   - The function is documented with a **clear, structured docstring** explaining:  \n",
    "     - **What it does** (checks if the market is open and returns the appropriate stock price).  \n",
    "     - **What arguments it takes** (`ticker` – the stock ticker symbol).  \n",
    "     - **What it returns** (a formatted string with market status and price).  \n",
    "   - AI agents rely on this information to understand the function’s role. When/if you build your own tool, it is critical to keep the same docstring template for your code to be compatible with the smolagents library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### **Key Takeaways for developping tools**\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Follow the function template:** Use clear type hints and structured docstrings.  \n",
    "- **Ensure proper decoration:** The `@tool` decorator registers the function within the SmolAgents framework.  \n",
    "- **Keep return types simple:** AI models parse these results, so returning formatted strings helps with interpretability.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach makes it easier for Agents to *call tools correctly, understand their functions, and use them effectively in reasoning and decision-making.*"
